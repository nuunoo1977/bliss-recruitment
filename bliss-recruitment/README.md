# BlissRecruitment

This project is part of Bliss Applications candidate evaluation for frontend positions.
Was developted by Nuno Felicio (nuunoo@gmail.com) in accordance with the Bliss Recruitment App Requirements Specification document (not included in this repo because of confidentiality and Bliss Applications ownership).

## Requirements

Before pulling the source code make sure you have the following software installed:

* Node.js 9.* 
* Git

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nuunoo1977/bliss-recruitment
cd bliss-recruitment
```
### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `4200`. Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

## Setup

The API URL can me configured in 'src/environments'.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
